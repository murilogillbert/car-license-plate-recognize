If this is your first time using the easyocr and OpenCV libraries, follow these steps:

Step 1: Ensure that your project is within a Python environment.

Step 2: Install the necessary libraries by running the following commands in your terminal:

pip install easyocr
pip install opencv-python

Note: It's important to install easyocr first because it includes
a version of the capture cam module that is compatible with OpenCV.
Installing easyocr first ensures that capture cam is updated 
to the required version when you install OpenCV afterwards.
